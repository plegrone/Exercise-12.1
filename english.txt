A geographic information system GIS is a system designed to capture store manipulate analyze manage and present spatial or geographic data. GIS applications are tools that allow users to create interactive queries user created searches analyze spatial information edit data in maps and present the results of all these operations GIS more commonly GIScience sometimes refers to geographic information science GIScience the science underlying geographic concepts applications and systems

GIS can refer to a number of different technologies processes techniques and methods It is attached to many operations and has many applications related to engineering planning management transport logistics insurance telecommunications and business For that reason GIS and location intelligence applications can be the foundation for many location enabled services that rely on analysis and visualization

GIS can relate unrelated information by using location as the key index variable Locations or extents in the Earth spaceâ€“time may be recorded as dates/times of occurrence and x y and z coordinates representing longitude latitude and elevation respectively All Earth based spatial temporal location and extent references should be relatable to one another and ultimately to a real physical location or extent This key characteristic of GIS has begun to open new avenues of scientific inquiry
